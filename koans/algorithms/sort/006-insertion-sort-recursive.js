/*
Recursive Insertion Sort has no performance/implementation advantages, but can
be a good question to check oneâ€™s understanding of Insertion Sort and recursion.
If we take a closer look at Insertion Sort algorithm, we keep processed
elements sorted and insert new elements one by one in the inserted array.
Recursion Idea.

Base Case: If array size is 1 or smaller, return.
Recursively sort first n-1 elements.
Insert last element at its correct position in sorted array.
