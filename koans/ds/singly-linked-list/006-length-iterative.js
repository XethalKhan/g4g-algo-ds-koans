/*
Write a function to count the number of nodes in a given singly linked list.

For example, the function should return 5 for linked list 1->3->1->2->1.

Iterative Solution

1) Initialize count as 0
2) Initialize a node pointer, current = head.
3) Do following while current is not NULL
     a) current = current -> next
     b) count++;
4) Return count
