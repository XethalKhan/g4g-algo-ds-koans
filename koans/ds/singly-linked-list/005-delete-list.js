/*
Delete entire linked list.

In JavaScript, automatic garbage collection happens, so deleting a linked
list is easy. Just need to change head to null.

For this exercise, iterate through the linked list and delete all the nodes
one by one. The main point here is not to access the next of the current
pointer if the current pointer is deleted.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
